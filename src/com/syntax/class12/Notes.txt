POM - page object model
is a design pattern which allows us to enhance test maintenence and reduce
code duplications

Advantages of POM:
1. Code reusability
2. Code maintainability
3. Object repository
4. Readability

How to implement
1. POM without PageFactory
2. POM with PageFactory

PageFactory is a class which allows us to interact with stored elements
in each class
