CSS Selector
it is another way of locating elements on the web page

Syntax:
tagname[attribute = 'attribute value']
button[type = 'submit']

CSS does not given an opporunity to locate the element by text

Shortcuts for CSS:
Shortcut for ClassName --> "."

Syntax: tagname.classNameValue
input.button

Shortcut for ID --> "#"
Syntax: tagname#IDValue
input#twotabsearchtextbox

contains() method in css:
* symbol represents contains method
tagname[attribute *= 'attribute value']
input[placeholder *= 'Email']

starts-with method in CSS:
 (Circumflex) symbol represents starts with method
 tagname[attribute = 'starting attribute value'

stupid question. Why do we need CSS selector by ID if we can just use By ID?

Xpath vs CSS
-- CSS cannot locate elements by text
-- no ends-with method in Xpath
-- CSS is faster than Xpath
-- CSS has shortcuts
-- no advanced CSS
-- CSS has more simple syntax than Xpath
