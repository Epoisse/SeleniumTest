Dropdown is a menu which gives us an opportunity to select one or more options

Types of dropdowns
1. Single select
2. Multiple select

2. using Select class
                in order to use Select class
                we need to make sure if there is a select tag


Selecting an option from a dropdown can be done in 3 ways:
